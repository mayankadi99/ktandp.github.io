                        <h1><strong>Khanda Terms and Conditions</strong></h1>
                        <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mkhanda.com">mkhanda.com</a> website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of
                            its related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this
                            agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do
                            not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you
                            acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically
                            signed by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services. This terms and conditions policy was created with the help of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/terms-and-conditions-generator"
                                rel="noopener">terms and conditions generator</a>.</p>
                        <h2>Age requirement</h2>

                            any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We do not
                            assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access
                            through a link on the Website. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>
                        <h2>Prohibited uses</h2>

                        <h2>Intellectual property rights</h2>
                        <p>“Intellectual Property Rights” means all present and future rights conferred by statute, common law or equity in or in relation to any copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents, inventions, goodwill and the right
                            to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to use, and all other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications and rights to apply for and be granted,
                            rights to claim priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of intellectual activity which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.
                            This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by the Operator or third parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with the Operator.
                            All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Website and Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos
                            used in connection with the Website and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Website and Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator or third party
                            trademarks.

                            fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third party allegations, claims, actions, disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use of the Website and Services
                            or any willful misconduct on your part.</p>
                        <h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
                        <p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Ontario, Canada without regard to its rules on conflicts or choice
                            of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Canada. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in Ontario, Canada, and you hereby submit to the personal
                            jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not
                            apply to this Agreement.</p>
